Rapper Guessin' Game

DESCRIPTION

Rapper Guessin' Game will be a simple game in which a user will click a button, and a snippet of rapping will play. The user will be given a list of rappers to choose which is being played in the snippet.

Guesses will be made via radio buttons. If the user guesses correctly, they will be displayed a next button, else, the snippet will play again until they answer correctly.

Upon correct answer, a picture of the rapper will be displayed.

At the end of the round, all of the rappers' pictures will be displayed as well as links to their wikipedia pages.

I have some stretch goals of:
- user name creation (persisted) and login functionality.
- have buttons to select different eras of hip hop history. (1979-1989; 1989-1995; 1995-2005, 2005-present)
- I'd also like to have a 'learn your hip hip history' links.
- I'd like to also, if I can and have time, add a clock to keep time.
